MAT436H1:Introduction to Linear Operators::36L:The course will survey the branch of mathematics developed (in its abstract form) primarily in the twentieth century and referred to variously as functional analysis, linear operators in Hilbert space, and operator algebras, among other names (for instance, more recently, to reflect the rapidly increasing scope of the subject, the phrase non-commutative geometry has been introduced). The intention will be to discuss a number of the topics in Pedersen's textbook Analysis Now. Students will be encouraged to lecture on some of the material, and also to work through some of the exercises in the textbook (or in the suggested reference books).

MAT437H1:K-Theory and C* Algebras::36L:The theory of operator algebras was begun by John von Neumann eighty years ago. In one of the most important innovations of this theory, von Neumann and Murray introduced a notion of equivalence of projections in a self-adjoint algebra (*-algebra) of Hilbert space operators that was compatible with addition of orthogonal projections (also in matrix algebras over the algebra), and so gave rise to an abelian semigroup, now referred to as the Murray-von Neumann semigroup. Later, Grothendieck in geometry, Atiyah and Hirzebruch in topology, and Serre in the setting of arbitrary rings (pertinent for instance for number theory), considered similar constructions. The enveloping group of the semigroup considered in each of these settings is now referred to as the K-group (Grothendieck's terminology), or as the Grothendieck group. Among the many indications of the depth of this construction was the discovery of Atiyah and Hirzebruch that Bott periodicity could be expressed in a simple way using the K-group. Also, Atiyah and Singer famously showed that K-theory was important in connection with the Fredholm index. Partly because of these developments, K-theory very soon became important again in the theory of operator algebras. (And in turn, operator algebras became increasingly important in other branches of mathematics.) The purpose of this course is to give a general, elementary, introduction to the ideas of K-theory in the operator algebra context. (Very briefly, K-theory generalizes the notion of dimension of a vector space.) The course will begin with a description of the method (K-theoretical in spirit) used by Murray and von Neumann to give a rough initial classification of von Neumann algebras (into types I, II, and III). It will centre around the relatively recent use of K-theory to study Bratteli's approximately finite-dimensional C*-algebras---both to classify them (a result that can be formulated and proved purely algebraically), and to prove that the class of these C*-algebras---what Bratteli called AF algebras---is closed under passing to extensions (a result that uses the Bott periodicity feature of K-theory). Students will be encouraged to prepare oral or written reports on various subjects related to the course, including basic theory and applications.

MST231H1:On the Move in Mediaeval Eurasia::24L:In this age of constant global travel, it is easy both to forget how much more complicated travel was in earlier periods, and to assume that there was very little of it. In the Mediaeval world, people travelled for work as traders, craftsmen and warriors; they travelled for their spirit as pilgrims; they travelled as migrants and refugees. This course will introduce students to the variety of people on the move in Mediaeval Eurasia, their motives, and the means they used to travel.:::::Humanities:
MST232H1:How to Be a Barbarian: Beard, Battles and Belief at the Dawn of the Middle Ages::24L:Barbarians have caught the modern popular imagination, and they appear to be much the same: hairy warriors who destroyed civilization. The late antique period (c.300–c.600) was a time of transition and the meetings of several cultures. This course examines the so-called barbarians who entered and soon came to rule the former Roman provinces of western Europe in this period. Our particular focus is the cultural, religious, artistic, and socio-economic aspects of barbarian peoples, and how these intersected with the civilization of Rome.:::::Humanities:
MST233H1:Viking Cultures::24L:Everyone thinks they know who the Vikings were. Like many aspects of the middle ages popular in modern life, there is much that is inaccurate about this picture of the Vikings. This course explores how Vikings lived—what sorts of things they did for a living, how they amused and entertained themselves, and what they thought—and moves on to consider their rituals of death and their notions of the afterlife. It will be based both on reading a variety of texts produced by and about the Vikings, as well as looking at various objects they produced that have survived.:::::Humanities:
MST234H1:Women's Lives in Mediaeval Europe::24L:Using an interdisciplinary lens, this course explores the experiences of Mediaeval women.

MST242H1:Mediaeval Mythologies and Methodologies::24L:The idea of the ‘middle ages’ is pervasive in Western thought, but only some of what is ‘traditional’ actually happened. This course introduces various interpretations, constrictions, and re-creations. Our analysis will draw on literary texts and their various interdisciplinary interpretations and applications.:::::Humanities:
MST300H1:Alexander the Great in the Middle Ages::24L/12T:Alexander the Great (356-323 BCE), king of Macedon, was one of the most successful military campaigners the world has ever seen. By the time he was thirty, he had established a vast empire stretching from Greece in the west to India in the east. Fantastic stories and legends about Alexander the Great circulated throughout the medieval world, from Iceland to Iran and from Ethiopia to England. In this course, we explore what different representations of the same figure can tell us about the range of medieval cultures. Through the use of digital tools, students and the instructor work together to explore this rich material. We trace the transmission of Alexander’s legend using digital maps. We compare different versions of the same story using text analysis tools. And we curate a small selection of the lavishly-illustrated manuscripts of the Alexander Romance in a digital exhibition.:MST201H1, or  MST202H1, or Permission of Instructor::::Humanities:

MST341H1:Middle Ages by the Numbers::24L:Numbers and their uses often appear to be absolute fact: a thousand dollars is exactly that, not more or less; and if you weigh fifty kilos, that’s what you weigh. But the use and meaning of numbers—for recording and counting dates, money, weights, distances, and myriad other functions—is not, in fact, devoid of cultural, historical, and political context. Mediaeval Europe provided a bewildering range of calendric systems, currencies, systems of measurement, and numerical symbolism was much used in art, music, religious thought, and literature. This course provides an introduction to the various uses of numbers in this period across different regions and cultural contexts.:Completion of 9.0 credits::MST210H1,  MST212H1::Humanities:

MUN101H1:Global Innovation I: Issues and Perspectives::24L:Innovation has always been a key driver of economic growth, population health, and societal success. Transformative change has historically been linked to major innovations such as urban sanitation, pasteurization, the printing press and the industrial revolution. Currently, the opportunity to enhance life chances worldwide relies on innovating for the poor, social innovation, and the ability to harness scientific and technological knowledge. What precisely is innovation? When does innovation happen? Who benefits from innovation? How can innovation be fostered, and how do innovations spread? Relying on major global transformations and country-specific case studies (for example, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel and India), this course examines the drivers of innovation, the political, social, economic, and scientific and technological factors that are critical to promoting innovation and addressing current global challenges, and the consequences of innovation. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:Admission to Munk One::::Social Science:
MUN102H1:Global Innovation II: Challenges and Solutions::24L:Governing public goods has been an age-old concern for social scientists and policymakers alike. This is not surprising since the provision of global public goods is riddled by problems of collective action. In this course, we focus on how to implement solutions through states, markets and communities. The first objective is to familiarize students with the concept of global public goods, the different mechanisms that can provide these goods and the challenges that emerge from lacking incentives to secure their provision. To this end, the course will introduce theories from sociology, political science, philosophy, and history to help us understand different types of governance mechanisms and how they may be used to scale global solutions. Theories can help us explain the tensions between cooperating for the public good at the expense of sacrificing individual goals, or why certain areas of our lives, like the Internet, seem to produce public goods without any formal mechanism of cooperation. The second objective is to use the class and subject of study as an arena to model and practice the kind of learning that is expected of university students. The main skills that the course will help students target and develop are: research (finding, evaluating and assimilating reliable information); writing (developing ideas into logically written arguments); and critical analysis of arguments presented in the readings and debated in class (this includes identifying the key assumptions that are implicit in different theories as well as inherent in our own positions on various questions related to governance). Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:Admission to Munk One::::Social Science:
MUN105Y1:Global Problem-Solving: Laboratory Opportunities::48L:This course teaches students how to conduct analytically rigorous social science research to improve their insights into complex global problems and devise innovative solutions to address them.

Students work hands-on in one of several labs dealing with some of the most intractable global problems of our time in the areas of the environment, health, digital governance, security and the gap between rich and poor. By the end of this course students will be able to:  Experience and practice the process of social science research  Narrow the scope of a complex global challenge into a manageable research problem that can be tackled over the course of the semester Improve their knowledge and insights on a particular global problem Develop a viable, compelling and implementable solution that can help address an aspect of a global problem Pitch a solution in a compelling way to a jury of experts in global affairs  Students will work with their peers in small seminar classes and lab group settings, mentored by graduate teaching assistants specializing in global affairs, expert faculty and senior policy advisors dedicated to addressing global issues in the fields of the environment, health, security, digital governance and political economy.

MUN196H1:Somebody’s Watching Me: The Global Politics of Surveillance::24L:From security cameras and cell phones, to drones and social media, our data are collected in countless ways. But who controls our data? Do we have a right to privacy? Does mass surveillance make us safer? This course invites students to explore the global politics of mass surveillance, and the role played by states, big tech, police, activists, and ordinary people. Through in-class discussion and analytical writing assignments, students will engage with surveillance studies through many dimensions, including public policy, human rights, international relations, economics, technological development, and race, class, and gender.

MUN197H1:Strong States or Weak People? Dictatorships in Modern Europe::24L:Who are the people and what role do they play in dictatorships? This course takes a case study approach to dictatorships in Europe in the 20h and 21st centuries. By looking beyond the frequently studied examples of Germany, Italy and the USSR, the class examines less-studied examples in the Balkans and Central Europe such as Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia and Albania in the years between the First and Second World Wars, alongside the continuities between those dictatorships and the communist regimes that followed. In contemporary examples, we examine Belarus and Russia alongside so-called hybrid regimes like Hungary. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Social Science:
MUN198H1:Digital Technologies and Human Rights::24L:What are digital technologies, exactly? How do we govern them? Do they threaten or protect human rights?

NMC101H1:Land of the Pharaohs::24L/12T:Egypt is one of the oldest known civilizations on the African continent. Deeply embedded within early African history, Egypt was also inextricably linked with the history of many civilizations in the Ancient Near East. From pyramids to mummies and from King Tut to the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the course will trace the history of ancient Egypt from its foundation around 3050 BCE to its incorporation into the Roman Empire in the 1st Century BCE. The focus will be on various aspects of Egyptian culture, including the institution of kingship, the role of women, and the characteristic features of Egyptian art, literature, and religion. Emphasis will be placed on the methods by which knowledge about this ancient civilization can be obtained.:::::Humanities:
NMC102H1:Heartland of Ancient Empires::24L/12T:Mesopotamia and the ancient Near East—the area of modern Iraq and adjacent regions—witnessed the rise of the first cities in the fourth millennium BC and the emergence of the world’s first empires in the first millennium BC. This course traces Mesopotamian history from the beginnings of agriculture through to the earliest cities, following the trajectory of political development from city states, to territorial states, and finally to the great empires of Assyria, Babylonia, and Achaemenid Persia and their aftermath. It studies the peoples and polities of the ancient Near East, including the Sumerians, Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians. It also examines their cultural contributions, from the development of cuneiform writing to their achievements in law, administration, science, art and architecture, religion, and literature.:::::Humanities:
NMC103H1:The Islamic World::24L/12T:A broad introduction to Islam, including the history, culture, and religion of the people and places that came to be influenced by Islam and that constitute a world civilization. What makes something (an empire or state, or a work of art or music) Islamic? When and how did that which we think of today as Islamic come about? How has “the Islamic” changed over time? With these questions in mind, this course introduces students to major figures, events, themes, institutions, and intellectual currents in Islamic history, from its beginnings in the 7th century to the modern period. Key topics to be covered include the rise and spread of Islam, the Qur’an and the role of Arabic, political thought, law and society, and literary and artistic expressions. Attention is paid to the geographical and ethno-linguistic scope of the Muslim world, demonstrating the diversity of peoples and traditions that make up Islamic civilizations.:::::Humanities:
NMC104H1:The Biblical World::24L/12T:Examine the history, lands, peoples, religions, literatures and cultures that produced the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament. Topics to be covered include an overview of the geography and history of Ancient Israel and Judea, the role of the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek languages, the literary genres reflected in biblical and some contemporary non-biblical texts, and the scholarly methods by which the Bible is studied.:::::Humanities:
NMC195H1:Rebels, Misfits, and Outcasts in Modern Arabic Literature::36S:This course examines modern Arabic literary texts that portray marginalized social figures and groups who have been excluded from a protective system of resources and privileges. Students will read novels and short stories by prominent Arab authors who have represented marginal social groups in their fiction, including representations of the urban poor, the peasantry, the delinquent, the prostitute, sexual minorities, women who reject normative roles, and the political rebel. These fictional texts address issues such as political resistance and rebellion, economic precarity, and social exclusion. Students will engage with these texts by critically examining the role of literature in narrating unspoken and suppressed histories. The class will also introduce students to theoretical modes of literary analysis and interpretation. All texts will be read in English translation. Authors include Mohamed Choukri, Hanan al-Shaykh, Alifa Rifaat, Sonallah Ibrahim, and Arwa Salih. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.::::NMC242H1:Humanities:
NMC196H1:Law and Order in the Ancient Near East::24S:Are human beings basically evil or good? What creates order in society? Coercion? Religion? Can societies operate without law? This course explores different systems of authority and control through ancient texts, focusing on the very first ideas of law in human history. We examine actual law codes, court cases on real estate disputes and conspiracy to commit murder and rape, as well as alternative means of regulating communities such as ideology, ritual and magic. While most courses on ancient law approach the topic from the perspective of modern concerns, this course situates the first law in its own historical, social and political context. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
NMC197H1:Myth and History in the Bible::24S:Reading the Bible is easy, but reading it well isn’t. Should we read its stories as history? All of it? Or perhaps only part of it? If so, which parts? And if some parts aren’t meant to be read as history, then what are they? Was Jonah really swallowed by a large fish? Did the sun and moon stand still for Joshua? Did Moses really part the Red Sea? Did Jesus really raise Lazarus from the dead? Are miracles necessarily fiction? In this seminar, we will read together many of the most colourful stories of the Bible, sometimes alongside similar stories from the cultural context of ancient Israel, and discuss what genre (history, myth, legend, folktale) they belong to and how this affects our reading of these texts. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
NMC198H1:Iranian Women Reveal Their Lives: The First Generation::24S:Persian women born in the late 19th century and first half of the 20th century were products of a period of major social and cultural change. For the first time, an educated female could envision a life beyond the conservative ideal of a woman's proper place in the home. We will use memoirs of women who were able to contribute to Iranian society and interviews with women whose ambitions were inhibited or repressed by the dominance of patriarchal culture. Poems by women of this early generation vividly reveal both anger and hopes for the future. Memories of a Persian Childhood helps us to appreciate the important role of the family and childhood experience in the lives and ambitions of the first generation of Persian women to be unveiled and have access to a modern education. Both the Course Readings and Seminar Discussions are crucial to this course for exploring Persian women as individuals who grappled with the challenge of government initiatives and social conservatism. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
NMC199H1:Babylon: Fact vs. Fiction::24S:The ancient city of Babylon, now a vast archaeological site in Iraq about 100km south of Baghdad, has captured people’s imagination up to this day. Who has not heard of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Biblical Tower of Babel, or the sci-fi TV series Babylon 5? Yet, how much of that reflects the reality of ancient Babylon? This course will explore the city of Babylon through its texts and archaeology and contrast this data with the way the city has been remembered over the past two thousand years. However, the goal of the course is not only to investigate how myths about Babylon have been constructed throughout the centuries. It will also look at the shortcomings of contemporary academic research on Babylon, and how difficult it is to reconstruct humankind's distant past. Restricted to first-year students. Not eligible for CR/NCR option.:::::Humanities:
NMC241H1:Anthropology of the Middle East::24L:This course aims to familiarize students with the anthropological study of the contemporary Middle East. It introduces key questions and concepts for anthropological study: who speaks for the Middle East? What is culture? What is ethnography? It analyzes systems of power and exclusion, and everyday life and relations in countries like Egypt, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel, and Kuwait. The course will provide critical perspectives on gender, religion, family relations, national belonging, migrant workers, and refugees. Students will apply anthropological methods learned in class to do an independent project.:::NMC278H1/ ANT207H1:RLG355H1:Humanities:
NMC243H1:The Arabic Novel::24L:This course focuses on the origins and development of the novel genre in the modern Arabic literary tradition. The course examines the aesthetic qualities of the novel as an artistic form as well as the ways it has represented and intervened in the modern social, political, and cultural upheavals that have shaped the Arabic-speaking world from the mid 19th century to the 21st century. Students will read literary criticism that addresses the Arabic novel’s emergence and consolidation as a major literary form and will engage with contemporary methods of literary analysis and interpretation. Topics addressed in the course include textual representations of colonialism and post-colonialism, gender and sexuality, representations of the peasantry, the nation-state and Arab nationalism, and discourses of progress and modernity. Authors include Ahmad Faris al-Shidyaq, Yahya Haqqi, Naguib Mahfouz, Tayeb Salih, Latifa al-Zayyat, Mohamad Choukri, and Hanan al-Shaykh. Readings of novels and criticism in English translation.:::::Humanities:
NMC244H1:The Arab Spring and Cultural Production::24L:This course examines the Arab revolutions that began in 2011 and their ongoing repercussions through the lens of cultural production. How have Arab writers and artists contributed to and reflected upon the Arab revolutions known as the Arab Spring? How has cultural production mediated the demands, aspirations, and struggles of the Arab peoples during and after these transformative revolutionary struggles? The cultural texts examined in this course range from those that mediate the euphoric optimism heralded by the revolutions to those that narrate and reflect upon the dystopian aftermath after revolutionary failure, including fiction and art that considers the reassertion of authoritarian rule, the violence of civil war, and the homelessness of exile. Through novels, poetry, music, art, and film, the course will broadly consider the role of culture as an alternative mode of narrating and historicizing the Arab revolutions.:3.0 credits at the 100-level::::Humanities:

NMC246H1:Sumerian and Babylonian Literature in Translation::24L:This course explores some of the world’s oldest literature, including the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Babylonian Epic of Creation. It surveys the major literary genres from ancient Mesopotamia, including epics, myths, lyrical poetry, wisdom literature, and humorous tales. It covers literary compositions written in the Sumerian and Babylonian languages using the cuneiform script, ranging in date from the third millennium BC through to the first millennium BC. The course also examines the scholarly and cultural context in which these works were created and preserved for posterity, including the role of scribal training, the nature of Mesopotamian scholarship, royal sponsorship, and the formation of ancient libraries.:::NMC102H1::Humanities:
NMC247H1:The Intellectual History of the Ancient Near East::24L:Survey of the intellectual life in the Ancient Near East from the emergence of writing in Mesopotamia and Egypt at the end of the third millennium BCE until the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Covers issues of orality vs. literacy, state and scribal control, notions of progress, origins and purpose of knowledge, as well as areas such as taxonomy of the natural world, astronomy, mathematics, medicine, divination.:::NMC101H1,  NMC102H1, or  NMC104H1::Humanities:
NMC248H1:Ancient Bureaucracies::24L:Where were taxes first collected? When was the first receipt issued? What did the first account ledgers look like? This course offers an introduction to the development of early bureaucracies in ancient Mesopotamia (Iraq), Iran and Syria. Find out how accounting procedures evolved after 6,500 BC, from closing storage containers in Neolithic villages with seals and sealings to complex recording procedures in urban settings that ultimately led to the development of writing on clay tablets around 3,100 BC. Learn how different patterns of irrigation in river-based agricultural societies such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China led to similar yet distinct systems of resource management and administration, using different writing materials (e.g. clay tablets, papyrus) based on available raw materials. And see how bureaucratic procedures, while helping to maximize efficiency in an ancient society, could also create a lack of flexibility, ultimately leading to political decline or collapse.:::NMC102H1::Humanities:
NMC251H1:Voices from Ancient Egypt::24L:This course introduces students to the culture of ancient Egypt through the study of “functional” textual materials. After a brief introduction to the Ancient Egyptian language and writing system, we will read texts from domestic, religious (comprising funerary and ritual), historical, and scientific backgrounds to paint a rich picture of the daily life and experiences of the ancient Egyptians. By way of example, we will illustrate Egyptian funerary beliefs on the basis of texts found in tombs, such as autobiographies, offering formulae, and letters left there for the dead by their families; or the role of the pharaoh for the Egyptian state by studying monumental inscriptions left on temple walls, boundary stelae, and in the tombs of the Egyptian elite. No knowledge of Ancient Egyptian required; all texts read in translation.:::NMC101H1::Humanities:

NMC253H1:Egyptian Myths::24L:This course explores ancient Egyptian mythical writings and representations, starting with the myths contained in the Pyramid Texts of the 3rd millennium BCE and ending with the narrative mythical tales of the 1st millennium BCE and beyond. Definitions and theories of ancient Egyptian myth as well as historical developments will be discussed, and we will attempt to explain why religious beliefs and stories changed. The course is structured systematically, focusing in particular on mythical accounts that elucidate Egyptian cosmic, royal, and funerary beliefs as well as the intersection of these domains. All texts read in translation.:::NMC101H1::Humanities:
NMC254H1:The Mummy: Technology and Transformation::24L:This course explores the significance of mummies in contexts ranging from ancient Egyptian to modern, tracing the development of Egyptian mummification techniques and the roles and uses of mummies as transformative elements allowing access to the afterlife, sources of information about ancient individuals, characters in literature and film, and objects for display in museums.:::::Humanities:
NMC255H1:Love, Battle, and Wit: Classics of Premodern Arabic Literature::24L:This course surveys the premodern Arabic literary heritage, from pre-Islamic poetry to literature of the Mamluk period, focusing on texts that remained influential sometimes until the present day. Students read classic works in translation each week, while discussion focuses on social context and close reading. Throughout, we note the development of literary forms over time, and the way authors reference previous works. Readings include: the animal fable book Kalila wa Dimna, excerpts from anecdote collections (adab), multilingual Andalusi songs (muwashshah), the linguistically playful trickster tales called maqamat, an obscene shadow play by Ibn Daniyal, popular epic, and some of the most famous poems by Labid, Jarir, Abu Nuwas, Abu Tammam, al-Mutanabbi, and Ibn Nubata.:::1.0 credit in Humanities/BR=1 or 2::Humanities:
NMC256H1:1001 Nights Around the World::24L:The 1001 Nights has had many lives, in many languages, and across many media. This course starts off with a detailed reading, in translation, of one of the oldest surviving Arabic versions of the text, with consideration of its literary and social context, and its sources. We then move forward in time to examine how the 1001 Nights was expanded, adapted, and disseminated from then until today. A key transformation moment occurred between 1704-1717 with the publication of Antoine Galland’s French version, composed with the input of Syrian storyteller Hanna Diab. This version was widely disseminated and became a basis for most subsequent modern adaptations. We consider adaptations both before and after this turning point, including manuscripts, translations, novels, ballets, short stories, and films produced around the world. Throughout, we consider the politics and aesthetics of these historical translations, adaptations, and transformations.:::1.0 credit in Humanities/BR=1 or 2::Humanities:
NMC257H1:Vice and Virtue in Biblical Traditions::24L:This course examines the formation and development of ancient Jewish literary traditions, centering around complex narrative and poetic figures such as Eve, Abraham, Moses, David, Esther, Job, and Lady Wisdom.

NMC258H1:The Book of Kings: Persian Myth, History, and Art::24L:The Shahnameh, or Book of Kings, is the single most important book in Iranian national culture and one of the great epics of world literature. Composed in Persian by the poet Ferdowsi in the late 10th–early 11th centuries, it had a deep and lasting impact not only on Iran, but also on those cultures that came under the influence of Persian language, literature, and courtly traditions. The course examines, in English translation, the Shahnameh’s presentation of the history of the mythical dynasties of the ancient kings of Iran from the creation of the world to the Sasanians, the last historical dynasty to rule Iran before the Muslim Arab conquests. As the Shahnameh was frequently illustrated, attention will also be devoted to the manuscript tradition, which exhibits some of the finest examples of medieval Persian painting.:::::Humanities:
NMC259H1:Literature of Ancient and Late Antique Iran::24L:This course explores the most important texts of the Zoroastrian literature of ancient and late antique Iran and serves as a broad introduction to the mythical and ritual world of Zoroastrianism and the contours of pre-Islamic Iranian thought. The course is divided into two parts: a) Old Iranian literature, such as the Avestan religious literature and the Old Persian inscriptions, and b) Middle Persian (Pahlavi) literature, including epic poetry (Chronicle of Ardakhshir, narrating the deeds of the first Sasanian king), didactic and wisdom literature (Memorial of the Vizier Wuzurgmihr; Explanation of Chess and Backgammon), apocalyptic and visionary literature (Book of the Righteous Wiraz, describing his journey to heaven and hell), texts on cosmology (Primordial Creation), and encyclopaedic works (Acts of the Zoroastrian Religion), as well as specimens of Manichaean literature in Middle Iranian languages.

Investigating the Great Transformations in Pre- and Proto- History::48L:This is an experiential course that asks what it would have been like for people in the ancient Near East as their world underwent the profound changes wrought by domestication, farming, urbanism, and state formation. We focus on the sensory experiences of the body, and their effect upon the mind, by reconstructing and using spaces and objects that have come to define the archaeological periods from 10,000 to 2500 BCE. From circular communal buildings and the constraints and possibilities they offer, to replastering skulls and making hand-held figurines, to the performance of a ritual text, we link traditional teaching with walking a mile in ancient footwear. Participation in this course requires an active imagination and a willingness to get physical.:::::Humanities:

NMC266H1:Archaeologies of Power::36L:Who were the first powerful leaders? How did they portray themselves, and what was the source and basis of their power? This course provides a comprehensive survey of the origins and rise of political leadership in the Near East from its beginnings in the Neolithic period to the famous kings and military leaders of Sumer, Assyria, and Babylon. Sources consulted include archaeological data (architecture, monuments, narrative art) as well as historical sources. The course is intended as an introduction to a broader understanding of the mechanisms that result in the formation of political power structures. Although it focuses on the ancient Near East, the course will discuss parallels from other parts of the world, both ancient and modern, that are relevant to understanding manifestations of political power in our present-day world.:::NMC102H1::Humanities:
NMC267H1:Everyday Life in Ancient Egypt::24L/12T:The course focuses on lived experience for people from many different socio-economic levels in ancient Egypt. Through the analysis of archaeological and mortuary evidence, artifacts, and human, animal, and plant remains we will explore the daily lives of Egyptians over time as the natural, social and technological landscape changed, posing questions such as what they ate, how they made things, what kinds of social connections they formed, how they defined their identities, what kind of houses and village, town, or urban settings they lived in, what things they feared, how they died, and what they might have believed. We will look at remains from settlements like Hierakonpolis, Abydos, Giza, Kahun, Tell el-Dab'a, Amarna, Deir el-Medina, and Thebes in detail to understand aspects of the lives of the people who inhabited them.:::NMC101H1:NMC362Y1:Humanities:
NMC268H1:Data Science Applications in Archaeology::12L/12P/12S:Digital technology and the growth of “big data” are transforming not only the ways in which archaeologists present and communicate their research, but also increasingly the ways they collect and analyze data.

NMC270H1:Christians of the Middle East::24L:The course will introduce students to the Christian communities living in the Middle East since the distant past, identified by ecclesiastical and or ethnic terms, including Armenian, Copt, Greek-Melkite, Maronite, and Syriac. The course will discuss the plurality of their cultural, literary, and theological traditions, the social and intellectual roles of their monasteries, the contributions of their top religious authorities in diplomacy between Byzantium and the Sassanians, their position in the Islamic world and contributions to Islamic culture, philosophy, sciences, and theology, interreligious dialogues and polemics with Islam.:::NMC102H1::Humanities:
NMC271H1:The Sufi Tradition in Islam::24L:The history of asceticism and mysticism in the Islamic tradition, with particular attention to the formative period as well as the breadth and diversity of Sufism across the Islamic world, from West Africa and Spain, to the Balkans and Central Asia, to China and Southeast Asia. We begin with the origins of the piety movement in early Islam, and the ways in which it responded to late antique Christian monasticism. We then examine the emergence of classical Sufism in the 9th century, its basic concepts and practices, the rise of saints, the formation of Sufi orders, the social and cultural context for key developments, as well as the reasons for the contested legacy of Sufism in the modern world. Major figures for discussion include Rabi'a, Junayd, Hallaj, Ghazali, Ibn Arabi, and Rumi.:::::Humanities:
NMC274H1:The Turks in History: From Nomads of the Steppe Frontier to Islamic Rulers::24L:The course examines the roles of Turks and other primarily nomadic peoples as raiders, migrants, slave-soldiers, and empire-builders in the ancient and medieval history of Eurasia (including Central Asia, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe) and in the formation of the Islamic world. Topics covered include long-distance economic and cultural contacts (“silk roads”) facilitated by “steppe empires”; the Islamization of the Turks and their gradual takeover of Iranian, Arab, and other Muslim lands; lifeways (especially pastoral nomadism); the relationship between nomadic and sedentary societies; political structures; steppe warfare; the role of physical geography and the environment. Students explore the histories and landscape geographies of Turks through fascinating primary sources and internet resources. The course illustrates the key role that Turks played in the formation of the modern world on the Eurasian continent.:::NMC103H1:NMC274Y1:Humanities:
NMC275H1:The Mongol Empire and the World It Made::24L:Most of Eurasia (the Middle East, East and South Asia, Eastern Europe) was once incorporated into the Mongol Empire and greatly influenced by Mongol rule. It may be said that the beginnings of modern history on the Eurasian continent were shaped by the impact of the Mongols and their non-Mongol (mainly Turkic) partners. This course explores the history of the pan-Eurasian empire founded by Chinggis Khan (Genghis Khan) in the 13th century and the smaller empires into which it devolved: Yuan China-Mongolia, Chaghatayid Mongolia-Central Asia, Ilkhanid Iran-Anatolia, and the Golden Horde Eastern Europe-Western Siberia. The course also surveys various post-Mongol successor states, such as the Timurid and Mughal Empires, and the Kazakh, Uzbek, and Crimean Tatar Khanates, as well as touches upon important non-Chinggisid successor polities, such as Muscovy-Russia and Slavic Cossacks. Students explore the history and landscape geographies of the Mongol venture through fascinating primary sources and internet resources.:::NMC103H1,  NMC274H1:NMC274Y1:Humanities:

NMC280H1:The Caliphate: Early Islamic History from Ancient Arabia to the Abbasid Empire::24L/12T:The formative period of Islam, including the Prophet and origins of the caliphate. This course surveys the history of the Middle East and its religious, social, and political transformations between late antiquity and the medieval period, from roughly the 6th to the 10th century CE. Starting with the available evidence on pre-Islamic Arabs, we study the making of the Islamic empire from Spain to Central Asia, the early caliphates (Umayyads, Abbasids, and Fatimids), the emergence of competing traditions in Islam (Sunnis, Shi‘is, and Ibadis), and other developments of enduring significance. Particular attention is paid to primary sources and scholarly debates on the challenges of early Islamic historiography.:::NMC103H1:NMC273Y1:Humanities:

This course surveys key developments in religion, politics, and society across the Middle East from the 11th century up to the 15th century CE. Starting with the situation on the eve of the Crusades, we trace broader patterns in Islamic history through the emergence of various sultanates (including the dynasty of Salah al-Din Ayyubi and the Mamluks) as well as regional dynamics from North Africa and Spain in the West to Iran and India in the East.:::NMC103H1:NMC273Y1:Humanities:
NMC284H1:Judaism and Feminism: Legal Issues from Menstruation to Ordination::24L:Agitation for change exists in religious practice worldwide in areas of access, status, inclusion, and egalitarianism. Traditional religion is often in conflict with egalitarian modernity. This sometimes results in difficulties with religious identification. This course will explore the interaction between feminism and Judaism. We will examine how Jewish law (halakhah) sometimes conflicts with ideas of egalitarianism particularly in legal disabilities for women such as divorce, lack of access to high-level Torah study, and discrimination in public religious roles. The traditional exemption of women from the obligation of Torah study had great impact on women’s religious responsibility and status. Various movements within Judaism competed in efforts to resolve these difficulties. In this course we will consider to what extent inclusion and egalitarianism have become complementary to traditional Judaism.:::::Humanities:
NMC289H1:Introduction to Coptic Studies::24L:Overview of the history of the Copts from political, religious, social and economic perspectives. Literary and documentary sources will illustrate these different aspects of Coptic Civilization.

NMC316H1:Cultural Encounter in Arabic Narrative::36S:This course examines historical and literary texts that narrate Muslim and Arab encounters with cultural difference. Students will read travel narratives, autobiographies, and fictional texts that chronicle encounters with the Arab-Islamic world’s cultural “others.” The course first examines travel narratives from the medieval Islamic period, including al-Sirafi’s travels to India and China, and Ibn Fadlan’s encounters with peoples inhabiting lands north of the Abbasid Empire, such as the Vikings. Students then consider how travel narratives in the modern period are transformed due to radical changes in the balance of power between Europe and the Middle East, first reading 19th-century travel narratives to Paris (al-Tahtawi), and then focusing on 20th-century texts that narrate the travels of Arab men and women to Europe and North America (Leila Ahmed, Sayyid Qutb, Nawal El Saadawi). Students will also read texts that depict encounters with non-Arabs within the modern Arab world, such as literary depictions of American oil workers in the Arab Gulf (Munif).

NMC330H1:King David: Musician, Monarch, or Murderer?::24L:For many people, King David is one of the most beloved characters in the Bible. But where did our ideas about David come from? Was he a brilliant poet who wrote many of the Psalms, a youthful champion who defeated the giant Goliath or as a ruthless monarch capable of killing his political opponents? This course will explore attempts to reconstruct the historical David from various biblical texts, comparable ancient literature, and what historians know (and don’t know) about the time in which his story is set. All readings will be in English. No knowledge of Hebrew is required.:4.0 credits at the 200-level::::Humanities:
NMC331H1:Samson: Lover, Liar, lion-slayer::24L:Over the centuries, Samson has captured the imagination of countless scholars, artists, and poets. Although often stereotyped as little more than a thoughtless strong man prone to violent outbursts, he is actually one of the most complex and enigmatic characters in the Bible. This course will explore biblical depictions of this often misunderstood figure and his complicated relationships with his family, his lovers, and his enemies. We will analyze his story within its ancient historical context and in some more recent interpretations. All readings will be in English. No knowledge of Hebrew is required.:4.0 credits at the 200-level::::Humanities:
NMC340H1:History of Late Antique & Early Islamic Iran::24L:The political, religious, and cultural history of greater Iran from Late Antiquity to the Mongol invasions in the early 13th century. The course surveys the reigns of the kings of the Sasanian empire (3rd–7th centuries); traces the progress of the Muslim Arab conquests in the mid-7th century that resulted in the Persian empire’s collapse and the gradual Islamization of its population; and examines the subsequent formation of regional Iranian dynasties that were instrumental in the creation of a new Perso-Islamic cultural identity.:::NMC280H1:NMC348Y1:Humanities:
NMC341H1:Safavid Iran: Reign of the Shahs::24L:The course focuses on the period of the Safavid dynasty (16th–18th centuries) which represented a watershed in the history of Iran not only because of its adoption and promotion of Shi‘ism as the state religion, but also on account of its fostering an imperial court culture that patronized the arts and architecture. The reigns of the Safavid shahs will be examined from the point of view of their political, religious, economic, and cultural history, as well as their relationship to the polities that immediately preceded them and their interactions with the contemporary Muslim states they neighboured, in particular, the Ottomans in the west and the Mughals in the east.:::NMC274H1,  NMC340H1:NMC348Y1:Humanities:

NMC353H1:Possible Worlds: Arabic Speculative Fiction::24S:This course examines the relationship between political critique and the textual production of possible worlds, taking the Arabic literary canon as its example. Among the key concepts analyzed will be history, time, language, and selfhood. Students will experiment with appropriately using concepts from modern critical theory in the analysis of premodern and modern Arabic literary texts. Readings include Qur’anic apocalyptic suras, the philosophical novel Hayy ibn Yaqzan, Sindbad the Sailor and other travel narratives, al-Maʿarri’s satirical narrative of a visit to the afterlife, trickster tales of the maqama genre. We then turn to the merging of novelistic forms, selfhoods, and conceptions of political organization with those of the maqama in early novels by al-Muwaylihi and al-Shidyaq, ending with contemporary conceptual art and a dystopic novel.:4.0 credits in Humanities/BR= 1 or 2::::Humanities:
NMC354H1:Abbasid Literature and the Sciences::24S:This course examines Arabic literary works of the Abbasid empire (750-1258 CE) that engaged with the flourishing study of natural sciences, Greek philosophy, and the philosophies of language and knowledge in the Islamic sciences.

NMC356H1:Anthropology of Islam::24L:This course introduces students to studies of contemporary Islam that are based on extensive periods of research with Muslim communities in their own languages using anthropological methods. What do such studies teach us about the varied ways Muslims engage with their religious tradition in the modern world? And how can such studies make us think differently about gender, economy, science, and secularism? We will discuss examples from Nigeria to Somalia, Egypt, Turkey, and Iran, to India, Pakistan, and Indonesia, to Canada, the US, and Europe. Students will apply anthropological methods learned in class to do research among a Muslim community in Toronto or online.:::NMC103H1/ RLG204H1/ NMC241H1/ ANT207H1:RLG355H1:Humanities, Social Science:

Class discussion considers debates in the field about how to analyze these texts in their historical context and in a theoretically grounded manner. Topics addressed include: popular and elite narrative representations of gender and sexuality; pre-Islamic and Abbasid poetry and remarks composed by women, and their transmission in male-authored anthologies; hetero- and homoerotic obscenity and eroticism in Arabic poetry, epistles, and scientific texts; and literary representations of sexual minorities like eunuchs, intersex people, and mukhannathūn (people with apparently male biology who dressed and behaved as women, and had a specific social position at certain times).:::4.0 credits in Humanities::Humanities:
NMC358H1:Gender and Sexuality in Modern Middle Eastern Cultures::24L:This course examines questions of gender and sexuality in the broader Middle East (Iran, Turkey, and the Arab world) from the colonial period (19th to early 20th centuries) to the present through readings of religious, cultural, historical, visual, and literary texts. We will begin the course by thinking critically about colonial and Orientalist legacies that continue to structure contemporary debates on representations of women, gender, and sexuality in the Middle East and North Africa. Students will read and analyze a range of primary historical texts written by Middle Eastern women reflecting the ways in which women of different backgrounds (religious, class, urban/rural) and generations have conceptualized and inhabited their gendered and sexual identities. Topics students will explore include the development of modern secular and religious feminist thought; cultural representations of gender, sexuality, and queerness; fictional texts that represent non-normative expressions of gender and sexuality; and critical approaches to theorizing gender and sexuality in the Middle East. All readings are in English translation.:3.0 credits in Humanities/BR= 1 or 2::::Humanities:

NMC365H1:Women and Gender in Egyptian Archaeology::36S:The course explores issues related to gender within the ancient Egyptian context and investigates the activities of women through the study of many different kinds of archaeological and material evidence. We'll build a foundation for this work with an overview of current developments in gender theory and consider their applications for research on ancient Egyptian society and culture. No prior knowledge of theoretical approaches is expected. From this basis, we'll go on to consider how archaeological material can contribute to the understanding of gender roles and examine how excavators may unconsciously impose their own gender perspectives on ancient contexts, creating biased views of ancient societies that become entrenched in scholarly tradition. The same methods of critical analysis will inform our study of women in ancient Egypt, incorporating archaeological data and artifactual material that can inform our understanding of the complex roles that women played in Egyptian culture, society, and religious practice.:3.0 credits in BR=1/2/3::NMC101H1 or ( NMC343H1/ NMC344H1) or  NMC251H1::Humanities:
